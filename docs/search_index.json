["abstract.html", "Abstract", " Abstract New teachers face numerous challenges during their transition from teacher preparation programs into professional employment contexts (i.e., their induction period), and they seek support from a variety of sources. Teacher induction research has reported a “two worlds pitfall” caused by conflicting messages about what and how to teach from the academic world of the preparation program and the practical world of the teaching classroom (Feiman-Nemser &amp; Buchmann, 1985). Further complicating teacher induction is the new reality that new teachers are no longer seeking help with their profession from just two worlds, but a universe of many worlds accessible through social media, an edu-verse. From interviews with new teachers (n = 9), I describe what supports for professional learning they seek during induction and how they use social media with the intention of seeking these supports. The reported findings will benefit new teachers, teacher educators, and mentors. Research Questions RQ1. What reasons, if any, do new teachers report for seeking induction supports, and what reasons do they give, if any, for not seeking induction supports? RQ2. What supports for professional learning, if any, are new teachers seeking during induction? RQ3. What interpersonal connections do new teachers make when seeking supports for professional learning during induction? RQ4. How, if at all, do new teachers use social media as a modality to access supports for professional learning during induction?

["reasons-for-seeking-induction-supports.html", "1 Reasons for Seeking Induction Supports", " 1 Reasons for Seeking Induction Supports I considered Bandura’s (2001b) three interconnected determinants of social cognitive theory (SCT), environmental, personal, and behavioral factors, when answering the first research question, “What reasons, if any, do new teachers report for seeking induction supports, and what reasons do they give, if any, for not seeking induction supports?” In the following paragraphs, I describe the environmental, personal, and behavioral factors reported by interview participants in this study. "],
["environmental-factors.html", "1.1 Environmental Factors", " 1.1 Environmental Factors The first set of Bandura’s (2001b) SCT determinants are environmental factors related to new teachers’ context. I identified three themes related to environmental factors: new teachers’ challenges related scarcity of resources, overabundance of resources, and change. Scarcity of resources manifested in the absence of curriculum, missing classroom materials, poor physical conditions of school, or a new teachers’ limited budget. Anne spoke at length and in detail about her urban school’s challenging physical environment. Her classroom is in a modular trailer that has air conditioning but lacks insulation for cold Midwestern winters. During the day, she has to keep her personal belongings in sealable plastic bags so that she does not inadvertently take bugs home with her. Amelia, as an itinerant music teacher serving several schools in a suburban district, lacks a dedicated music classroom and can teach only with whatever supplies she can find herself and carry with her. On the other end of the spectrum, some schools did provide resources (e.g., curriculum, classroom supplies, technology, funds for graduate school), but challenges sometimes arose from overabundance. An oversaturation of resources sometimes overwhelmed new teachers. For instance, Hallie described the process of sorting through materials left behind by her predecessor: I had a room chock full of like very old materials, like a bunch of garbage. There were some valuable things in there, but very few. So I had to spend multiple hours just cleaning junk out, things like an overhead projector things and other things that are just not helpful at all. But I found a couple like helpful resources for math and stuff. For Julie, the overwhelming volume of resources was epitomized by one object in her classroom: There’s a filing cabinet in my room that was in the corner; no one touched it. The teacher before the teacher I replaced had taught there for like 45 years. And that was his entire filing cabinet of work. Julie took the time to look through the entire filing cabinet and was able to find a few useful resources. She moved the filing cabinet from the back corner of the classroom to beside her desk, and she began to mix in fresh assignments as well. In addition to school-provided resources being overwhelming, new teachers also experienced them as constraining. For instance, Mike works in a wealthy suburban district and has been provided a detailed curriculum. However, Mike finds this environment to be stifling in its own way: This is one of my biggest challenges. I feel very constrained. Especially in a high school math class, we have an insane amount of standards to cover. And standards are good, because you know, you should have certain goals to meet, and you should be able to say, “Today I did this objective,” whatever you want to call it. But when you have the amount that you have as an educator, it takes any wiggle room out of the equation… That is my biggest concern for my teaching career: that I will get burnt out because all the fun stuff is stripped out. The kids don’t actually want to learn it because of that, and it’s not even useful for them for the most part. Mike observed that environmental factors go beyond material needs to include systemic issues of what is expected of educators generally and new teachers specifically: “These problems are stemming from a system that is starting well before students come to me.” Mike suggested these systemic issues cannot be solved by more or better induction supports: “I have all of the best supports that you can ask for as an educator. And I still have these problems.” A third area of environmental factors involved change, disruptions, and uncertainty experienced by new teachers. On one hand, change is inevitable when transitioning into a new career, as was the case of each of these new teachers. Simone expressed this sentiment well: I feel like I’m still a student, not just because I’m in graduate school. But education is always changing. There’s always something new. We go to professional development of how we can teach English language learners and how we can deal with, with social and emotional issues and trauma in your class. So I just feel like I’m always learning. However, new teachers also reported additional challenges related to change. The transition into teaching seemed especially challenging for Julie and Wallace, who started as new teachers mid-year. Amelia, as an itinerant music teacher, did not find out her final teaching assignments until October. Anne experienced a high degree of personnel turnover, including her principal and her mentor teacher. Anne and Simone both described being handed new curricula each year, and the process of adjusting to a new plan never seemed to stop. Simone was also asked to pilot new curricula: First year teaching, it was all new curriculum. And then, second year teaching, new science curriculum, rolling into the reading and writing curriculum, then I’m piloting a new math curriculum. So it’s a lot, yeah, trying to adjust to that… New teachers described numerous effects of so much change, including Wallace’s description of a physical manifestation of his stress: “I was clenching my teeth so hard that my mouth was getting sore from it, but it was just me trying to get through everything.” "],
["personal-factors.html", "1.2 Personal Factors", " 1.2 Personal Factors The second set of Bandura’s (2001b) SCT determinants are personal factors specific to an individual new teacher. I identified two themes related to personal factors: teacher capital and teaching beliefs conflicting with those held by colleagues. Teacher capital can be understood as resources priorly held by or inherent to a new teacher as they enter the teaching profession. These resources include social capital (i.e., resources related to interpersonal connections) and cultural capital (i.e., resources related to knowledge and skills). An example of social capital was Wallace’s ability to ask other teachers and staff for help during his first year, something he was more comfortable doing because he had worked on staff at the school prior to starting as a teacher. He also noted that being connected to colleagues on Facebook reinforced these in-school relationships by giving him additional understanding of his co-workers. Taylor and Blair demonstrated a lack of cultural capital. They both work as specialist teachers in wealthy private schools, albeit in different states, and they both reported having many material resources and supportive colleagues. However, because they did not study education as undergraduates, they felt like they were missing some foundational teaching skills. Taylor noted: “There’s planning, there’s preparation, but I think there’s something completely different to understanding how to organize a class, how to organize a lesson, how to build that up throughout the entire year.” As a school educational technology specialist, Blair commented on lacking a teacher’s identity: I didn’t really view myself as an educator, but like, the second I walked into a school, I was Ms. Blair. And I’d never been called that in my life. And it’s because kids don’t care what my position is. The fact that I’m an adult in this building means I’m a teacher. These teacher capital examples illustrate how new teachers sought induction supports because they knew who to ask, they felt like they were missing essential teaching skills, or because they were needing to step into a novel professional identity. A second area of personal factors pertained to conflict, the tension between new teachers’ previously held beliefs about teaching and those encountered in their school of employment. This tension manifested in a variety of ways. For instance, Julie experienced dissonance with her school’s strict policy on classroom management and student discipline. She characterized school norms as “We run a tight ship,” with teachers expected to send students to a responsible thinking classroom (RTC) following any violation of classroom rules, even minor infractions. Julie disagreed with this policy and expressed her opinion to her principal: I’m only going to do RTC when it gets to this point. I’m not going to do RTC every single day. That’s just not something that I can justify. And for a lot of those kids, it doesn’t work. I don’t really see the success in it. Hallie, as a first-year teacher, described dissonance with her more experienced colleagues around curricular issues: “I have one teacher who just wants to use curriculum from 30 years ago. And I’m just like, ‘I can’t do it.’ There are just completely irrelevant things.” Hallie also advocated for the inclusion of more antiracism materials in the elementary school curriculum. When her colleagues complained about their students’ reactions to discussing racism during Black History Month, Hallie responded: Well, that’s the problem. It’s uncharted, and it’s February. And now you’re talking about Black people, because it’s Black History Month, and you’ve never talked about race before. And you have one Black student in your class. These examples illustrate how new teachers must choose the degree of conflict they are willing to have with colleagues around issues of student discipline or racism, among other important topics where educational thinking has changed in recent years. "],
["behavioral-factors.html", "1.3 Behavioral Factors", " 1.3 Behavioral Factors The third set of Bandura’s (2001b) SCT determinants are behavioral factors related to new teachers’ activity patterns. I identified four themes related to behavioral factors: maintaining personal-professional boundaries, connecting socially, planning, and enacting practice. New teachers’ desire to maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives involved conscious choices to keep aspects of their personal and professional lives distinct. For instance, Simone talked about improving her time management as a new teacher: So at the beginning of the year, it was really rough for me. So when I first started teaching, I was doing plans week by week, I will plan my whole week out. And then this year, since I started the Master’s degree program, I didn’t want to bring any work home, and I didn’t want to stay late, and I’m not a early morning person. So then it was getting things done day by day. In addition, because each of the new teachers I interviewed used social media in some capacity related to their teaching role, teachers’ personal and professional contexts could intersect, collide, and conflict in one digital space or app. New teachers consistently described how they worked to avoid this convergence effect of social media. Mike was one of the most regimented in his social media use and content consumption. He described: I just can’t afford the time. I have to have time for my students, and I have to have time for myself. And if I don’t have time for myself, then I’m doing them a disservice. I have to have that shut-off button. Generally, new teachers reported using Facebook and Instagram to sustain personal relationships, but a few teachers reported using Facebook groups to access professional communities of teachers or Instagram to follow other teachers. Pinterest and TeachersPayTeachers, on the other hand, were viewed fully on the professional side. New teachers used these two platforms to find teaching resources when needed. Some teachers used Twitter for professional purposes only when required to for graduate school courses. Otherwise, Simone noted, “I use Twitter as my comedy,” and Taylor used Twitter to sustain a “decent following” of fans from her adjacent career as a professional athlete. A consistent thread through new teachers’ discussions of social media was this desire to separate personal and professional. Julie succinctly summed up her approach: “I know what I’m getting myself into when I open each one of the apps.” A second area of behavioral factors was connecting socially, activity that included both positive aspects of social glue and negative aspects of social comparison. New teachers reported positive social benefits of connecting with colleagues through professional learning communities (PLCs) in schools of teachers organized by grade level or subject. For instance, the physical education (PE) department in Taylor’s school shares an office, and PE teachers convene regularly throughout the day. The school policy is for departments to meet monthly, but other teachers joke that the PE department meets daily. Taylor described this PLC as a “tight-knit group” with a “group mentality” that functions not just as a source of teaching ideas, but a loyal in-group. Mike described the importance of new teachers’ having social outlets for teaching-related frustrations: I vent for my mental health. I vent to other teachers and other people about this stuff. I would say, frequently, just to be honest. And that’s scary to say, because I am at a premier school that has premier students, and it has great funding for electives and extracurriculars and resources and technology. Like, I couldn’t be at a better school. New teachers often described their social media use in connecting terms. For instance, Anne noted: “A lot of times, if I go to social media, it’s for an outlet, for frustrations, and difficulties.” Simone talked about the benefit of getting perspective through connecting socially: “It’s always nice to see what other teachers are dealing with in their district or their state. Like, ‘Are you experiencing these same things?’ It’s nice to know that you’re not the only one.” However, new teachers also described how connecting socially can be detrimental. Anne, teaching under difficult circumstances with few resources and a challenging physical environment, noted the challenges of seeing teachers in other districts present pristine classrooms on social media: Back to the Instagram thing, I do follow some teacher accounts. Sometimes I feel like, it makes me feel like a crappy teacher, because I’m seeing them do all these things. And I’m like, “I’m tired right now. If I did all those things, I would either never sleep, or I would be just doing those things. I wouldn’t be able to follow through with them and actually teach with those tools that they’re spending hours making on the weekend.” And it just, it makes me feel like I should be doing more. But I already feel like I’m doing more than I can keep up with. Julie perceived new teachers’ (and her own) social media use as primarily about sharing and finding resources. She expressed a desire for more genuine interaction and collaboration: “I wish there was more a way to use social media like, ‘Here’s a problem I’m dealing with; can people help me with this problem?’” A third area of behavioral factors was planning. All teachers prepare for teaching ahead of time, which includes generating ideas, creating curriculum, writing lesson plans, and finding appropriate resources. Taylor and Blair, without undergraduate teacher preparation, struggled with creating a semester-long teaching plan. However, they were not alone in this difficulty. Because her district did not assign a curriculum to follow, Hallie, who graduated from one of the top teacher preparation programs in the U.S., nevertheless described her internal process of deciding what to teach in her specific school: “What am I supposed to do? Like, what do you actually want me to do?” She also acknowledged the openness of her colleagues, but limitations remained: “There are teachers that are willing to help, but because my team doesn’t do a lot of the actual same activity, it doesn’t really help to share planning resources, always.” Julie was candid about this issue: “I feel like I filled a lot of gaps. If I couldn’t find something, I’d go to social media to find it.” Alongside challenges of unclear expectations and needing to fill gaps, an additional planning difficulty for new teachers is navigating the overwhelming number of possibilities of what and how to teach. New teachers’ efforts to seek induction supports from any sources possible, ranging from school colleagues to social media, sometimes result in too many ideas. New teachers often turned to school colleagues for planning help, including team teachers, mentor teachers, and PLCs. However, Julie found the helpfulness of colleagues to be overwhelming at times: I felt like a lot of teachers were saying, “Here, try this. Here, try this.” And I didn’t really have the time to fully plan out units or plan out weeks at all. I just, there was no time for that. A lot of people were just trying to throw me ideas and there weren’t people I could really go to for ideas. The unidirectional flow of ideas from colleagues to new teachers seemed to be part of the trouble for Julie. She said she would rather have people she could seek out when she was ready to work on planning and encountered a challenge. In addition, new teachers often reported turning to social media to find teaching resources while they were planning. Pinterest and TeachersPayTeachers seemed to be the most popular platforms for this. New teachers described both browsing through potential resources as well as searching with a specific need in mind. Amelia found TeachersPayTeachers to be a good source for plans to leave for substitute teachers and a district Facebook group to be a good place to ask for curriculum and materials. A fourth area of behavioral factors was enacting practice, where new teachers seek to improve their instruction and interactions with students in the classroom. New teachers’ exhibited this theme when they described issues like classroom management, student engagement, and helping students. For instance, Amelia, Anne, and Julie each talked extensively about difficult classroom management situations they had encountered, and how they worked through these in conversation with colleagues, mentor teachers, and principals. For instance, Hallie talked with her PLC about “embedding real learning ideas” in discussions of current events like voting instead of “reading a story and making it work with a standard.” She went on to say how figuring out her teaching practice in this way helps her as well as her students: “I enjoy my job a lot more teaching real things, and I think students come away with it more than just memorizing, and being able to do a standard on a standardized test.” New teachers noted that social media help enact practice too. Taylor found that YouTube videos are especially use to demonstrate activities for her PE classes. Julie noted she did not always turn to social media to figure out what to teach, but sometimes to refine an existing plan: “I still do a lot of that stuff, just somewhat in the same ways and somewhat with some extra TeachersPayTeachers flair.” "],
["types-of-induction-supports-for-professional-learning.html", "2 Types of Induction Supports for Professional Learning", " 2 Types of Induction Supports for Professional Learning I approached the second research question, “What supports for professional learning, if any, are new teachers seeking during induction?,” by drawing from Bandura’s (2001a) agentic perspective on SCT to distinguish between required and voluntary supports. In the following paragraphs, I report how new teachers described their assigned, latent, and self-directed supports. "],
["assigned-supports.html", "2.1 Assigned Supports", " 2.1 Assigned Supports Of the numerous induction supports described by new teachers, many were assigned to them. In many cases, new teachers appreciated assigned supports such as mentor teachers, PLCs, new teacher cohorts, and curricula. For instance, Julie, as an 8th-grade English Language Arts teacher, reflected on how she was supported in different ways by three different mentor teachers during her first three years of teaching: I had our eighth grade science teacher for part of my mentorship too, which was nice because she was teaching the same kids that I was. So it was more like we communicated about students there. And seventh grade English, I communicate more about English stuff there. And then with the sixth grade history teacher, we don’t really have much in common, but it was nice to just see a completely different successful way of teaching… I like having all those different mentors. However, there were also supports assigned to new teachers that they found to be unhelpful or unnecessary. Anne’s school assigned curricula for different subjects, but continuously introducing new curricula was unhelpful: It seems like every year we get some kind of new curriculum. I know my first year we switched to all new reading and writing, well it was reading, writing, and word study. Then the next year, it wasn’t completely new, but they revamped our math. This year, they dumped our science program, got a new science program. And it sounds like social studies is in the works for next year. In addition, paraeducators assigned to support new teachers were not always helpful. Simone, a 1st Grade teacher, recounted a support meeting with a social worker, a literacy coach, and a several special education teachers. She was telling them about her unsuccessful attempts to engage one of her students, and this is how she recounted the meeting: The one doing most of the talking just like, “With this kid, I don’t have a lot to say.” And I just felt like… [audibly sighs]. Yeah, so basically she said, for him, I have to turn everything into a game. He loves to play. So basically like being in a preschool. So while the other kids are sitting at their desk, writing on their papers, I have to turn this into a interactive thing for this child, which is a lot of work to do for one child. I was keeping lots of data on this student, where I could tally three behaviors to focus on, tally how often he shows these behaviors. And then l asked myself, “What am I doing this for?” I’ve talked to the parents, I’ve told them… So I would just say I’m doing this for no reason. Simone found her interactions with paraeducators to be patronizing and unhelpful, creating busywork for her that she did not believe would benefit her students. "],
["latent-supports.html", "2.2 Latent Supports", " 2.2 Latent Supports New Teachers identified many additional potential supports besides those that had been formally assigned to them. In some cases, they recognized a support’s potential helpfulness but chose not to use it. New teachers chose not to pursue these latent supports for a variety of reasons. For instance, Amelia voiced how helpful it would be to have a district-wide gathering of music teachers, but it may not have occurred to her that she could have helped to organize this group. Mike recognized that social media like Twitter represented opportunities for support for new teachers, but he chose not to use Twitter because his primary concern was managing his time. Similarly, Hallie and Simone were more compelled by personal-professional boundaries than social media benefits. Like Mike, Taylor saw Twitter’s potential for interactions amongst new teachers but chose not to pursue these because she perceived Twitter discourse as being constrained by the platform’s limits on message length. Because these latent supports were not assigned as part of the new teachers’ job requirements, they represented opportunities for self-directed learning that could be on-demand, just-in-time, and as-needed. However, this could alternatively be viewed as volunteering personal time to work. Blair was blunt about this: There were times when different teachers, like that one teacher I really liked working with, would say, “Oh, if you ever have downtime, you can just come to my classroom and observe or help out so you get more experience.” And, and in the moment I was like, “Yeah, that’s a great idea!” But then like, when the time actually came, I was like, “No, I don’t want to go work when I’m not working.” In this case, Blair admired the teacher making this invitation. Her reticence to pursue these supports was linked more to her limited capacity as a new teacher: “I feel like there are more things like that, when there is an opportunity to learn more, that I don’t take because I don’t feel like it, because I would rather do nothing.” "],
["self-directed-supports.html", "2.3 Self-directed Supports", " 2.3 Self-directed Supports Still, despite the demands of transitioning into a new job, new teachers reported many examples of how they pursued voluntary, self-directed professional learning. They pursued informal avenues within the school building when they sought out colleagues during planning periods or in the teachers’ lounge. They intentionally chose to follow and connect with other teachers through social media. They enrolled in graduate programs of education and participated in regional and national organizations that supported their teaching. One of my final questions in each interview was whether there were any additional supports the new teacher could think of but did not pursue. Wallace captured the sentiment of self-directed learning: No, I pretty much always was reaching out to whoever would help me. I kind of knew, like you said, the challenges were there and I was looking out for help, any way I could get it at that time… I feel like it’s a cheap answer, but I just can’t think of a time that I didn’t ask someone for help. Even if it was my wife, or I don’t know… I can’t think of any time that I would just fail and just accept it and not reach out. Wallace’s reflections exemplify the drive exhibited by the new teachers I interviewed. Although some teachers did not pursue every voluntary opportunity for induction support available to them, each of these teachers did take on more than was required in their job description. In sum, the types of induction supports sought by new teachers can be understood as either required or voluntary. New teachers seemed to benefit less from required supports that they did not perceive as useful (e.g., staff meetings or professional development covering topics irrelevant to them). New teachers also chose to pursue many voluntary, self-directed avenues of support as well, including many through social media. But when they perceived the challenges (e.g., time, energy, money) to outweigh the benefits, new teachers did not pursue those supports. "],
["interpersonal-connections-for-induction-supports.html", "3 Interpersonal Connections for Induction Supports", " 3 Interpersonal Connections for Induction Supports I approached the third research question, “What interpersonal connections do new teachers make when seeking supports for professional learning during induction?,” by considering interpersonal connections for induction support in light of previous work on teacher networks (e.g., Bartell et al., 2019; März &amp; Kelchtermans, 2020), noting the location of connections as occurring within a new teacher’s school or outside. "],
["in-school-connections.html", "3.1 In-school Connections", " 3.1 In-school Connections In many cases, new teachers sought induction supports through relationships inside their school building. These included both formally required supports such as mentor teachers and PLCs (whether organized by grade level or subject) as well as informal supports initiated by the new teacher, such as talking to colleagues in the teachers’ lounge. These in-school connections were also reinforced through social media modalities. Wallace worked at his school for several years as a staff member prior to being hired to teach midyear. He was connected to many school colleagues on Facebook, and believed that having this additional source of personal connection (e.g., seeing photos of coworkers’ children) improved the ways he was supported during his transition into teaching. As another example, Wallace described how fellow 10th-grade English teachers in his school used a Google Classroom shell to share teaching ideas and resources with each other. "],
["out-of-school-connections.html", "3.2 Out-of-school Connections", " 3.2 Out-of-school Connections New teachers sought induction supports beyond their school buildings as well, whether local or more far-reaching. At the local district level, there were some formally required supports for new teachers, such as district-wide professional development gatherings. Amelia described several informal initiatives in her district. She participated in a Facebook Group composed of music teachers in the district, where colleagues could post questions and requests for the sharing of musical instruments. Amelia’s PLC included teachers from 10 schools and, at the time of our interview, had just begun using Microsoft Teams as “a way for us to meet and actually talk about stuff… a way for us to communicate in the interim between our two-week meetings.” New teachers described turning to friends and family members for encouragement and even ideas when those connections were themselves experienced educators. New teachers also joined groups organized to support teachers. For example, during her undergraduate years, Simone joined a sorority for African American women, and after graduation, she continued to attend local gatherings of sorority sisters in her city. Many members are teachers, and Simone found them to be an important emotional and professional support as she started teaching. Mike attended a local group for new teachers that was organized as an informal partnership between his school district and the teacher preparation program at the nearby research university. Mike was also a member of a prestigious, national organization whose mission is to provide high quality professional development in problem-based learning to a select group of math teachers. These supports are different types of distributed networks, which expand beyond teachers’ school building but still rely on face-to-face meetups. Finally, new teachers also sought induction supports through networks hosted online. They looked to social media for opportunities to vent their frustrations, seek solidarity, exchange ideas, and find resources. For instance, Taylor subscribed to another PE teacher’s YouTube channel to get inspiration for her classes as well as visual instructions for how to teach various activities: He does these amazing YouTube videos that break down by stages and how to run different drills and games for PE, and I think that’s probably the most helpful thing that I’ve seen online. Simone participated in Facebook group teachers from all over the U.S.: It’s always nice to see what other teachers are dealing with in their district or their state like, “Are you, are you experiencing these same things?” And they are, and it’s nice to know that you’re not the only one. Simone appreciated not just the ideas and resources from this group, but also the perspective they were able to offer her. She was reminded that she was not alone feeling the way she did, and that there were other ways to teach besides what she had experienced in her own school and district. These perspectives seemed especially important to Simone as a Black teacher whose preparation program was overwhelmingly white, and whose school of employment was diverse but under-resourced. "],
["social-media-as-modalities-for-accessing-induction-supports.html", "4 Social Media as Modalities for Accessing Induction Supports", " 4 Social Media as Modalities for Accessing Induction Supports I approached the fourth research question, “How, if at all, do new teachers use social media as a modality to access supports for professional learning during induction?,” by coding each mention of an induction support with the modality through which it was accessed. I coded these in broad terms: offline, online graduate school (because each of the interview participants was enrolled in such a degree program), and social media. I focus my attention here on offline and social media modalities. "],
["offline-modalities.html", "4.1 Offline Modalities", " 4.1 Offline Modalities New teachers mentioned numerous offline modalities, including face-to-face staff meetings, district professional development, teachers lounge conversations, local gatherings of teacher organizations, and many others ways of connecting without the use of the Internet. New teachers often linked experiences in these modalities to their in-school connections (e.g., administrators, colleagues) and assigned supports (e.g., mentor teachers, PLCs). Induction challenges like enacting practice and conflict were often discussed in conjunction to an offline setting. "],
["social-media-modalities.html", "4.2 Social Media Modalities", " 4.2 Social Media Modalities New teachers also mentioned numerous social media modalities. These included a variety of social media types, including social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; content sharing sites like Instagram, Pinterest, and TeachersPayTeachers; and group messengers like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email listservs. New teachers often linked social media modalities to their out-of-school connections, self-directed supports, and latent supports. Induction challenges like planning and maintaining personal-professional boundaries were often discussed alongside social media modalities. Only one new teacher I interviewed was familiar with their school’s official social media policy, and then only because a teacher had been fired recently for violating it. This means that for the most part, schools and districts were not providing guidance to teachers regarding using social media at all, let alone as a means for new teachers to access induction supports. "],
["ways-of-engaging.html", "4.3 Ways of Engaging", " 4.3 Ways of Engaging I interpreted new teachers’ ways of using various modalities to access induction supports through Prestridge’s (2019) social media engagement categories: info-consumer, info-networker, self-seeking contributor, and vocationalist. Because the new teachers I interviewed rarely talked about seeking induction supports in ways that could be interpreted as information networking or self-seeking contributions, I dropped these codes. Here I only report results for consumer and vocationalist. New teachers engaged their support networks as consumers when they sought induction supports for self-interested reasons, whether searching by browsing or by asking. I used the term “consumer” rather than Prestridge’s (2019) “info-consumer” because new teachers were looking for more than just information. Sometimes their induction supports were material goods and physical resources. Browsing involved following district curriculum, looking up resources on TeachersPayTeachers.com, watching YouTube videos, and scrolling through Pinterest. Asking involved seeking out a mentor teacher for advice, posting on social media about resources needed, and venting or personal sharing in hopes of receiving emotional encouragement. Engaging as a consumer was not a passive form of participation. Indeed, some processes of browsing for resources could be quite sophisticated, and some asking conversations could be quite extensive. For instance, to save time, Mike developed a system that would allow him to skim resources more quickly: I have a Pinterest for the sole purpose of teaching. So, again, I don’t engage with it, I don’t go on and search for things. I have it set up where it sends me one email a day with about 10 different math activities or blog posts, whatever you want to call it, over the courses I teach. Hallie also wanted to save time, and she hated meetings without a purpose. Thus her preference for her weekly mentor meeting was to check in for five minutes, then get back to her planning period while her mentor made copies. But when it came time to work through her educator effectiveness plan, Hallie asked her mentor teacher to walk through the process step-by-step. Because she had never developed professional goals before, Hallie found this specific mentoring conversation to be just what she needed. On the other hand, new teachers engaged their support networks as vocationalists when they sought induction supports by participating as a member of a learning community. Engaging as vocationalist took various forms: both formal and informal, harmonious and conflictual. The key characteristic is that vocationalists participate in interaction and dialogue for mutual benefit, such as contributing ideas to a group, giving advice on social media, and conversing with colleagues to determine best practices. Taylor exemplified the vocationalist mindset. Throughout her interview, it was clear that she identified as a member of the PE department team and benefited from this association. She described how they were a tight-knit group: We’re able to bounce ideas off of one another. But there’s definitely that, you know, if we have someone telling us something about the PE department, it’s like the whole PE department versus everyone else. We have that group mentality. Taylor’s vocationalist engagement with the PE department meant that she felt connected and encouraged. She had trusted colleagues with whom to discuss ideas. Furthermore, when she searched YouTube or PE teacher blogs to look for ideas and resources, it was not just for her own benefit. Rather, she looked for things to bring back to the group that would benefit the whole team. "],
["conclusion.html", "5 Conclusion", " 5 Conclusion Social media create new opportunities and new tensions that are not yet fully understood by educational researchers. As the “edu-verse” continues to expand beyond the traditionally conceived two worlds of teacher preparation programs and PK-12 schools to include online modalities like social media, new teachers’ understanding of emerging learning ecologies and their own agency must expand as well. The purpose of this study is to explore what supports for professional learning new teachers seek during induction and how they use social media with the intention of seeking these supports. This study fills a gap in the literature by considering both the scope of potential interpersonal connections made through social media and the particular needs of new teachers. In addition, findings add new categories to scholarly understanding of new teachers’ PLN development, especially in terms of why and how new teachers seek supports. "],
