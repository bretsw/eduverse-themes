# Themes from "Into the Edu-verse""

This repo contains a brief reporting of thematic results from interviews with nine new teachers for my dissertation, rendered using the [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) R package, which in turn was built on top of R Markdown and [**knitr**](https://github.com/yihui/knitr).

Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this proposal into HTML. Detailed instructions are available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html). Finally, the simplest instructions I found for getting started with **bookdown** are [here](http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html).

In short, you may generate a copy of the book in the  `bookdown::gitbook` (i.e., HTML) format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')`.
